Launching my first EC2 in AWS
# AWS EC2 Launch Project

This project documents the step-by-step process I followed to launch my first Amazon EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console. It is part of my cloud engineering learning journey and demonstrates my understanding of AWS compute services.

---

## 🚀 What I Did
- Opened the EC2 console
- Launched a new EC2 instance
- Selected an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
- Chose an instance type (t2.micro)
- Created a key pair for secure login
- Configured network settings and security groups
- Launched the instance and verified it was running

---

## 🧱 Technologies Used
- Amazon EC2
- AWS Management Console
- IAM (for key pair and permissions)
- Security Groups

## 🪜 Step-by-Step Summary

1. Open EC2 Console
I navigated to EC2 from the AWS Services menu.

### 2. Launch Instance
Clicked **Launch instance** and named my instance.

### 3. Choose AMI
Selected **Amazon Linux 2023** (Free Tier eligible).

### 4. Choose Instance Type
Selected **t2.micro** (Free Tier eligible).

### 5. Create Key Pair
Created a new key pair to securely connect to the instance.

### 6. Configure Network
Enabled auto-assign public IP and created a security group allowing SSH from my IP.

### 7. Launch
Clicked **Launch instance** and waited for the instance to enter the **running** state.

---## 📌 Why This Project Matters
This project shows that I understand:
- How to deploy compute resources in AWS
- How EC2 works at a beginner level
- How to configure basic networking and security
- How to document cloud projects professionally

## 📎 Next Steps
- Connect to the EC2 instance using SSH
- Install software on the instance
- Create a web server (Apache or NGINX)
- Automate EC2 setup with user data scripts
